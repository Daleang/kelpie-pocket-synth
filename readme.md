## KELPIE - a polyphonic pocket synth

### About
The KELPIE is a digital polyphonic synthesizer powered by the SGTL5000 audio DAC and an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller. After messing around with the Teensy Audio Shield last year and making it to the semi-finals of the 2018 Hackaday Prize Contest, I wanted to design and develop a synthesizer that had a more traditional user interface.
